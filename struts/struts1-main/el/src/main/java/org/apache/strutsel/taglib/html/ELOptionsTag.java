/**
 * Tag for creating multiple &lt;select&gt; options from a collection.  The
 * associated values displayed to the user may optionally be specified by a
 * second collection, or will be the same as the values themselves.  Each
 * collection may be an array of objects, a Collection, an Enumeration, an
 * Iterator, or a Map. <b>NOTE</b> - This tag requires a Java2 (JDK 1.2 or
 * later) platform. <p> This class is a subclass of the class
 * <code>org.apache.struts.taglib.html.OptionsTag</code> which provides most
 * of the described functionality.  This subclass allows all attribute values
 * to be specified as expressions utilizing the JavaServer Pages Standard
 * Library expression language.
