    <section name="Welcome to Struts Scripting" id="overview">
      <p>This component allows Struts Actions to be written in the scripting
      language of one's choice rather than as Java classes.  It uses the
      <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf">Bean Scripting Framework</a>
      to allow scripts to be written in any language BSF supports like Perl,
      Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Groovy, and even VBScript.
        </p>
      <p>
        Struts Scripting allows an application to be developed rapidly with
        the quick development cycle (edit file -> refresh browser) that one
        would expect in a scripting environment.  Furthermore, it enables other
        non-Java trained members of a development group, such as web designers who
        may have a scripting background, to be more involved, leaving the Java
        developers to create the reusable services the Struts actions will interact
        with.  Finally, when used with Java-like languages such as <a
        href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a>, applications can quickly be
        stood up, then later the Struts action scripts can be migrated to Java for
        better performance.
      </p>
